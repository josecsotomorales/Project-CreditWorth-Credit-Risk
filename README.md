# Project-CreditWorth-Credit-Risk
In this project we use four classification models to predict credit risk in a Bank. Using Alteryx we validate the best model for this task, and a comparisson between those ones.
MODELS:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Forrest Model
- Boosted Model

We have three workflows in Alteryx, one for set the best model, other to score the model against the dataset to predict, and another that transformate the results for summarize.
